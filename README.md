# Java Programming Challenges

## Introduction
This project presents a series of programming challenges for beginning Java programmers.
These challenges were developed to supplement Java training for a high school First Robotics team.

## Challenge 1 - Hello!
From scratch, write a Java program to display a greating on the console. You should include comments in your program that explain how it works. Be prepared to answer a mentor's questions about your source code.

## Challenge 2 - Custom Hello
Modify your previous program so that it displays a custom greeting for the user. The user can optionally include a name on the command line that will be the recipient of the greeting. Be sure to handle both cases - running the program without a parameter and running the program with the user's name as a parameter.

## Challenge 3 - Object Oriented Programming
Create a new Java program that includes the following features of Object Oriented Programming (OOP):
* Encapsulation
* Inheritance
* Polymorphism
You should have a base class that at least two other classes extend.
